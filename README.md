# BackToEarth (Unity Version 2021.3.1f1)
 A game where the goal is to get your spaceship out of the maze and back to earth!
 
 The initial part of this videogame will be built following section 3 of the course "Complete C # Unity Game Developer 3D" on Udemy.
 Unlike Obstacle Course, my goal is to create an Open Source game where everyone can contribute new ideas and improvements for the game!

 I will update this README file to notify when the last commit will be done following the lessons of the course!
 
 # 08/08/2022 Finished section of the course
 From now on, all commits will be the result of what I have learned!

# Game Theme
You are a space pioneer who is coming back from an extrasolar space mission, you are forced to stop on Pluto because you notice that there are alien structures on the planet and on the other planets of the solar system, including the earth!

Your new mission is to overcome all obstacles and get Back to Earth!

# Future additions
- [ ] There will be 7 levels in all (One per planet of the solar system).
- [ ] I would like to add intermediate landing pads to the level, so as to decrease the difficulty (If you lose before reaching a final landing pad you restart from the
last landing pad "touched").
