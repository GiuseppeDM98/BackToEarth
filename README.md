# BackToEarth
 A game where the goal is to get your spaceship out of the maze and back to earth!
 
 The initial part of this videogame will be built following section 3 of the course "Complete C # Unity Game Developer 3D" on Udemy.
 Unlike Obstacle Course, my goal is to create an Open Source game where everyone can contribute new ideas and improvements for the game!

 I will update this README file to notify when the last commit will be done following the lessons of the course!

# Game Theme
